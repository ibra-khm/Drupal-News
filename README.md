# Drupal-News Hi! :)
Drupal News Website
Welcome to the Drupal news website repository!

This repository contains the source code for a Drupal-based news website. The website is built on the Drupal content management system, which provides a user-friendly interface for publishing and managing news articles.

# Installation
To set up the Drupal news website on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Install Drupal by following the instructions at https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/installing-drupal-8
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/drupal-news-website.git
3. Import the database included in the repository into your local Drupal installation. This can be done through the Drupal interface or by using a tool such as mysql on the command line.
4. Modify the settings.php file in the sites/default directory to reflect your local database and file system paths.
5. Visit the website at http://localhost/drupal-news-website in your web browser to begin using the Drupal news website.

# Usage
To publish news articles, log in to the Drupal interface using the administrator account and navigate to the "Content" section. From here, you can create and publish new articles, as well as manage existing ones.

The website includes a custom theme that can be modified by editing the files in the themes/custom directory. If you wish to use a different theme, you can install and activate it through the Drupal interface or by placing the theme in the themes directory and enabling it in the settings.php file.
